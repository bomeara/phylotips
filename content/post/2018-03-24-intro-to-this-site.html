<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.phylotips.info">PhyloTips.info</a>. From teaching my <a href="http://www.phylometh.info">PhyloMeth</a> course and working with students and colleagues in general, as well as the great example of Liam Revell’s <a href="http://blog.phytools.org">Phytools Blog</a>, I decided to make a site where I could post tips to deal with problems of people working on phylogenies. Since I mostly use R for this (though this may change as Julia, Python, etc. grow) I have created the site using the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown">blogdown</a> package of <a href="https://yihui.name/en/">Yihui Xie | 谢益辉</a>, which allows R Markdown to be beautifully rendered into a hugo website (I’m currently using the <a href="https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even/">Even</a> theme), with deployment on the free tier of <a href="https://www.netlify.com">netlify</a>.</p>
<p>This makes overall deployment easy: <code>blogdown:::new_post_addin()</code> for a new post (if done within RStudio) and <code>blogdown::build_site()</code> to render the site, then <code>git add -A</code>, <code>git commit -m&quot;updated site&quot; -a</code>, and <code>git push</code>, and everything gets redeployed.</p>
